# WaymoProject
# First Part: Waymo Motion Dataset Visualizer from Tutorial(DID NOT WRITE CODE FOR THIS)

A lightweight Python tool for visualizing agent trajectories, roadgraphs, and traffic light states from the **Waymo Open Motion Dataset** tutorial.  
This script decodes a `.tfrecord` file and generates a smooth animation of all agents (vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists) over time.

## Example Animation

Below is a sample of the generated trajectory animation:

## Features
- Parses **Waymo Motion Dataset** TFRecord files directly using TensorFlow.
- Visualizes:
  - Past, current, and future agent trajectories.
  - Roadgraphs and traffic lights.
- Exports animations as `.mp4`, `.gif`, or `.html`.
- Compatible with **Docker**, **VS Code**, and **Jupyter Lab** environments.
